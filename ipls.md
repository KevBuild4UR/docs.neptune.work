# Available IPLs

Explore the list of IPLs available for the creator. Each IPL also comes complete with Descriptions, Images and Coordinates! The list will continue to be updated.

## How to load an IPL in the creator? (Dev Survival Creator Only)

There is an unnamed tab in the "Survival Details" option of the survival creator. After entering the tab, you need to select the third or the fourth option to load IPLs (the third tab is exteriors and the fourth tab is interiors) in a survival. Some interior options may be included in a submenu. In the following, we will also attach a screenshot of the submenu to which they belong (the submenu comes first, and IPL options follows).

## How to enter an IPL in the creator? 

There are two ways to help you enter the interior in the creator, one is only suitable for Survival or Arena Wars Series  dev creator, and another one is suitable for all dev creator environments.

### Press "Space" key (Keyboard) or "X" key (Controller) (Available in Dev Survival Creator and Dev Arena War Series creator)

You only need to find the interior you have enabled and press "Space" key (Keyboard) or "X" key (Controller) to quickly teleport to the loaded interior.

### Use "Cycle Items" option

You can directly teleport into the interior through the first-person "Cycle Items" option in developer mode. This is impossible in the current ordinary creator. (These interiors are generally not loaded in the game, in the survival creator you will be free to choose whether to enable these interiors)

The first step is to enter the first-person view, and use the "Override options" to move the props to the interior, After the settings are completed, the props will be used as a waypoint.

The second step is to select the "Cycle Items" option to switch to the prop you set to be used as a waypoint.

The third step is to remove the prop or select the prop to enter the collision-free state. At this time, you have successfully entered the loaded interior. If you were not teleport to the waypoint prop you set after teleporting, but were teleported to the surface, the reason is probably that the interior has not been loaded yet. If multiple attempts still fail, please try to save the job and reload it or start a test (the purpose is to reload the online contents).
